## News

- Qitmeer Medina Network Token Pmeer was listed on Huobi Pool. On November 12, 2020, Qitmeer Network, in collaboration with Huobi Pool, held an online AMA event with the theme “Huobi Pool & Qitmeer”. Affected by this, the average daily hashrate of Qitmeer Medina Network increased by 17.2%, and the peak hashrate increased by nearly 30%.
